# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains Python code for various data structures and algorithms, implemented as part of my studies in computer science.
Data Structures

The following data structures are included:

    Linked List

The following data structures will be included:

    Stack
    Queue
    Binary Tree
    Binary Search Tree
    Heap
    Hash Table
    Graph

Each data structure is implemented in a separate Python file, along with sample usage code.
Algorithms

The following algorithms will be included:

    Sorting algorithms:
        Bubble Sort
        Selection Sort
        Insertion Sort
        Merge Sort
        Quick Sort
    Searching algorithms:
        Linear Search
        Binary Search
    Graph algorithms:
        Depth-First Search
        Breadth-First Search

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file, along with sample usage code.
